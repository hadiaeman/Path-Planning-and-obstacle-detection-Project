# Path-Planning-and-obstacle-detection-Project
This project demonstrates a path planning algorithm with obstacle detection using Dijkstra's algorithm in C++. The program generates a grid environment with obstacles represented by 'X' and free spaces represented by '.'. Users can input source and destination coordinates to find the shortest path while avoiding obstacles.

Example
An example grid environment with obstacles and path:

Acknowledgments: 

This project is a basic implementation of path planning with obstacle detection using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Inspired by the need for efficient path planning in robotics and autonomous vehicles.


Note:
This project is a demonstration and may require further optimizations for real-world applications. Contributions and improvements are welcome.
